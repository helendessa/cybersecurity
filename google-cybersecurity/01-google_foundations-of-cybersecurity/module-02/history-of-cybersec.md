# Past cybersecurity attacks

- Computer virus: malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. Today, more commonly refered as malware.  
- Malware: software designed to harm device or networks. Ex.: Brain virus, Morris worm.

## Attacks in digital age
Threat actors no longer need to use physical disks to spread viruses.

### LoveLetter attack
- Email "Love Letter For You" with attachment -> when open, sent to the user's address book -> program to collect user info and passwords.  
- Example of social engineering.  
- Social engineering: manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private info, or valuables.  

Now, it's commom for employees to receive training on how to identify social engineering attacks, as pishing.  

## Equifax
Data breach (credit card company), 2017, 40% of americans.  

The company failed to take actions needed to fix multiple known vulnerabilities in the months leading up to the data breach.  

## Commom attacks and their effectiveness
### Pishing
Use of digital communications to trick people intro revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.  

Most common types:
- Business Email Compromise (BEC): a threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.  
- Spear pishing: a malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.  
- Whaling: a form of spear pishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.  
- Vishing: the explotation of eletronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.  
- Smishing: the use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.  

### Malware
Software designed to harm devices or networks.  
The main purpose is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person/org/territory.

Most common types:
- Viruses: malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
    - Needs to be initiated by a user.  
    - Transmitted via malicious attachment/file.  
- Worms: can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. 
    - No need to be downloaded.  
    - Spread by other devices on the same network.
- Ransomware: threat actors encrypt an org's data and demand payment to restore access.  
- Spyware: used to gather and sell info w/o consent.
    - Can be used to access devices.  
    - Allows personal data collection.

### Social engineering
Manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private informations, access, or valuables.
Human error is usually a result of trusting someone w/o question.

Most common types:
- Social media pishing: collects data information about the target from social media sites. Then, they iniate an attack.  
- Waterig hole attack: attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.  
- USB baiting: a threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.  
- Physical social engineering: a threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

#### Social engineering principles
Reasons why social engineering is effective:  
- Authority: threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.  
- Intimidation: persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.  
- Consensus/Social proof: people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate.  
- Scarcity: imply that goods or services are in limited supply.  
- Familiarity: fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  
- Trust: emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time.  
- Urgency: persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

# Eight CISSP security domains
CISSP has defined eight domains to organize the work of security professionals.

## Security and risk management
Define:
- Security goals and objectives.  
- Risk mitigation.  
- Compliance.  
- Business.  
- Continuity.  
- Law.  

## Asset security
- Focuses on securing digital and physical assets.  
- Also related to storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.  

## Security architeture and engineering
- Focuses on optimizing data security.  
- Ensure effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.  

## Communication and network security
- Focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.  

## Identity and acccess management
- Focuses on keep data secure.  
- Ensure users follows establisheds policies to control and manage physical assets. 

## Security assessment and testing
- Conduct security control testing.  
- Collect and analyze data.  
- Conduct security audits to monitor risks, threats, and vunerabilities.  

## Security operations
- Conduct investigations.  
- Implement preventive measures. 

## Software development security
- Use security practices.  
- Create secure apps and services.

# Determine the type of attack

## Password attack
Attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. 
Common types:
- Brute force
- Rainbow table.

Fall under the communication and network security domain. 

## Social engineering attack
Manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
Common types: 
- Phishing.  
- Smishing.  
- Vishing.  
- Spear phishing.  
- Whaling.  
- Social media phishing.  
- Business Email Compromise (BEC).  
- Watering hole attack.  
- USB baiting.  
- Physical social engineering.  

Related to the security and risk management domain.

## Physical attack
Affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. 
Common types:
- Malicious USB cable.  
- Malicious flash drive.  
- Card cloning and skimming.  

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain. 

## Adversarial artificial intelligence
Manipulates  artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. 

Falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

## Supply-chain attack
Targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. 
The security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain
Fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

## Cryptographic attack
Affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. 
Common types:
- Birthday.  
- Collision.  
- Downgrade.  
Fall under the communication and network security domain. 

# Understand attackers
Threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk. 

## Advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- Significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. 
- Tend to research their targets in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. 
- Intentions and motivations can include:
    - Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources.  
    - Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents.  

## Insider threats
- Abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. 
- Intentions and motivations can include: 
    - Sabotage.  
    - Corruption.  
    - Espionage.  
    - Unauthorized data access or leaks.  

## Hacktivists
- Driven by a political agenda.  
- Their goals may include: 
    - Demonstrations.  
    - Propaganda.  
    - Social change campaigns.  
    - Fame.  

# Hackers 
Any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. 

## Ethical hackers:
- Authorized.  
- Code of ethics/adhere to the law.  
- Safeguard people and orgs.

## Researchs:
- Semi-authorized.  
- Research for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

## Unethical hackers.  
- Don't follow or respect the law.  
- Collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.
Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals: 
- Learn and enhance their hacking skills
- Seek revenge
- Exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered unethical or ethical hackers. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.
