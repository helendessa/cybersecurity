## Ethical concerns and laws related to counterattacks 

- US: 
    - Deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal.  
    - Counterattacking = act of vigilantism.  
    - Vigilante: a person who is not a member of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own.  
    - Counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack.  
    - If the threat actor is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications.  
    - Allowed to counterattack: approved employees of the federal government or military personnel.  

- International laws:
    - The International Court of Justice (ICJ) states that a person/group can counterattack if the counterattack:
        - Will only affect the party that attacked first.  
        - Is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.  
        - Doesn't escalate the situation.  
        - Effects can be reversed.

## Ethical principles and metodologies

- Confidentiality: only authorized users can access specific assets or data. 
    - There needs to be a high level of respect for privacy to safeguard private assets and data.

- Privacy protection: safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. 
    - Personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) are types of personal data that can cause people harm if they are stolen. 
    - PII data: any information used to infer an individual's identity. Ex.: name and phone number. 
    - SPII data: a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines. Ex.: social security numbers and credit card numbers. 
    - Security professionals hold an ethical obligation to secure private information, identify security vulnerabilities, manage organizational risks, and align security with business goals. 

- Laws: rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. 

You have an ethical obligation to protect your organization, its internal infrastructure, and the people involved with the organization. To do this:

- Remain unbiased and conduct your work honestly, responsibly, and with the highest respect for the law. 
- Be transparent and just, and rely on evidence.
- Ensure that you are consistently invested in the work you are doing, so you can appropriately and ethically address issues that arise.
