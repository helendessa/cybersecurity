# Tools and their purposes

## Programming
A process that can be used to create a specfic set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.

- Automation: use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks.  
    - Reduce risks of human error.  
    - Python, SQL (database).  

## Operating system

Interface between the hardware and the user.
- Ex.: Linux, macOS, Windows.  
- Linux: open-source, involve the use of CLI.  

## Web vulnerability
A unique flaw in a web app that a threat actor can exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.

## Antivirus software
Used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. 
- Depending on the type, it can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware.  

## Intrusion detection system
An application that monitor system activity and alerts on possible intrusions.
- Analyzes network packets.  
- Can detect theft and unauthorized access.  

## Encryption
Makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user.
- Main goal: ensure confidentiality of private data.
- The process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. 
- Cryptographic enconding: converting plaintext into secure ciphertext. 
- Plaintext: unencrypted information.  
- Secure ciphertext: the result of encryption.  

Note: Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. Encoding uses a public conversion algorithm to enable systems that use different data representations to share information.    

## Penetration testing  or pen testing
The act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.
- A thorough risk assessment that can evaluate and identify external and internal threats as well as weaknesses.
