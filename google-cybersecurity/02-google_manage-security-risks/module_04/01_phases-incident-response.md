# Introduction

Playbook: manual that provides details about any operational action.  

- Clarify what tools should be used in response to a security incident.  
- Ensure that people follow a consistent list of actions in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case.
- Different types of playbooks are used (for incident response, security alerts, teams-specific, and product-specific purposes)  
- Frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats  
    - A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself. 
    - There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.
    - The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.
- Focus on incident response playbook.  

# Incident response playbook

Incident response: quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach  

- Six phases used to help mitigate and manage security incidents from beginning to end.

- Preparation: 
    - Documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users  
    - Ex.: outline the roles and responsibilities of each security team member.  
- Detection and analysis: 
    - Detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology.  
    - Helps security analysts determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude  
- Containment: 
    - Prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident.   
    - Helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data
- Eradication and recovery:  
    - Complete removal of an incident's artifacts so that an organization can return to normal operations  
    - Also known as IT restoration.
- Post-incident activity:
    - Documenting the incident
    - Informing organizational leadership
    - Applying lessons learned to ensure that an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents.  
    - Depending on the severity of the incident:
        - Full-scale incident analysis to determine the root cause of the incident and implement various updates or improvements to enhance its overall security posture.
- Coordination: 
    - Reporting incidents and sharing information, throughout the incident response process, based on the organization's established standard  
    - Ensures that organizations meet compliance requirements and it allows for coordinated response and resolution.
