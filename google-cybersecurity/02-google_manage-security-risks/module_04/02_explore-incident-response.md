#  How a security analyst might use a playbook to address a SIEM alert

- 01) Assess the alert: determining if the alert is actually valid by identifying why it was generated by the SIEM  
- 02) The playbook outlines the actions and tools to use to contain the malware and reduce futher damage  
- 03) Eliminate all traces of the incident and restore the affected systems back to normal operations  
- 04) Post-incident activities and coordination efforts with the security team: creating a final report, reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities
