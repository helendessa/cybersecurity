# Introduction
One of cybersec many roles is to handle an org's digital and physical assets, an item perceived as having value to it.
Ex.:  physical office spaces, computers, customers' PII, intellectual property, such as patents or copyrighted data, and so much more. 

## Threat and Risks
Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.  
It's different from risks!  
Risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.  
- The likehood of a threat occurring.  
- Low, medium and high.  
- The level depends on possible threats and the value of an asset.  
Assets can be classified as low, medium or high risk:
- Low-risk asset: info that wouldn't harm the org's reputation or ongoing operations, and wouldn't cause financial damage if compromised.
    - Ex.: public info, as website content, or published research data.
- Medium-risk asset: might include info not available to the public and may cause some damage ot org's finances, reputation, or ongoingo operations.
    - Ex.: the early release of a company's quartely earnings could impact the value of their stock.
- High-risk asset: any info protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an org's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.
    - Ex.: assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.

## Vulnerabilities
A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
Note: both vulnerability and threat must be present for there to be a risk.
Ex.: an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data; or people. 

People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network. Whether it's a client, external vendor, or employee, maintaining security must be a united effort.

## Ransomware
A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an org's data then demand payment to restore access.
It can:
- Freeze network systems  
- Leave devices unusable  
- Encrypt or lock confidential data  
Then, the hackers demands a ransom before providing a decryption key.  

## Layers of Web
- Surface: the layer that most people use. Contains content that can be accessed using a web browser.  
- Deep: generally requires authorization to access it. Ex.: an org's intranet. 
- Dark: only accessed by special software. Provides secrecy.

## Key Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities
- Financial Impact
    - Ex.: interrupted production and services, the cost to correct the issue, and fines if assets are compromised because of non-compliance with laws and regulations.
- Identity Theft
    - Ex.: . sensitive data can include personally identifiable information, or PII, which can be sold or leaked through the dark web.
- Damage of Organization's Reputation
    - Ex.: can lead customers to seek new business relationships with competitors or create bad press that causes permanent damage to an organization's reputation. The loss of customer data doesn't only affect an organization's reputation and financials, it may also result in legal penalties and fines.
