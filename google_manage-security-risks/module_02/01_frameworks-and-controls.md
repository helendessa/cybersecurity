# Frameworks 
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
- Support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations.
    - Ex.: the healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires that medical professionals keep patient information safe. 

Security involves more than just the virtual space. It also includes the physical, which is why many organizations have plans to maintain safety in the work environment. For example, access to a building may require using a key card or badge.

Other security frameworks provide guidance for how to prevent, detect, and respond to security breaches. This is particularly important when trying to protect an organization from social engineering attacks like phishing that target their employees.

People are the biggest threat to security. So frameworks can be used to create plans that increase employee awareness and educate them about how they can protect the organization, their co-workers, and themselves.

# Controls
Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 
- The measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.
    - Ex.: a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records.

Three common types:
- Encryption: converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. 
    - Typically, involves converting data from plaintext to ciphertext.   
    - Used to ensure confidentiality of sensitive data.  
- Authentication: verifying who someone or something is.  
    - Vishing: exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source. Could be used to impersonate a person's voice to steal their identity and then commit a crime. Can exploit biometrics.  
- Authorization: granting access to specific resources within a system.
    - Used to verify if a person has permission to access a resource.  

# Relationship between frameworks and controls

## Specific frameworks and controls

### Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
Developed by the U.S. government to provide “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.” 
- Helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. 
- Allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.

### International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001
An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001.  

The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets.  
- Outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks.  
- Doesn't  require the use of specific controls, but does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture. 

### Controls
Used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability. Used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues. Can be:
- Physical: 
    - Gates, fences, and locks  
    - Security guards   
    - Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors  
    - Access cards or badges to enter office spaces 
- Technical:
    - Firewalls   
    - MFA  
    - Antivirus software  
- Administrative:
    - Separation of duties  
    - Authorization  
    - Asset classification
