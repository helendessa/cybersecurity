# Introduction
CIA: core security model that helps inform how orgs consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
- Confidentiality:  only authorized users can access specific assets or data.  
    - Data should be available on a "need to know" basis.  
- Integrity: data is correct, authentic, and reliable.  
- Availability: data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.  

## How to use
Bank example.:
- Confidentiality: the bank must keep people's personal and financial information safe.  
- Integrity: if a person's spending habits or purchasing locations change dramatically, the bank will likely disable access to the account until they can verify that the account owner, not a threat actor, is actually the one making purchases.  
- Availability: put a lot of effort into making sure that people can access their account information easily on the web. And to make sure that information is protected from threat actors, banks use a validation process to help minimize damage if they suspect that customer accounts have been compromised.
