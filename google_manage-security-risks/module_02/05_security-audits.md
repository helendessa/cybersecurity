# Introduction
Review of an org's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of internal or external expectations. 
- Can be used to assess an organization's established security controls. 
    - Security controls: safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. 
- There are two types: 
    - External:
        - Regulatory compliance  
        - Laws  
        - Federal regulations.  
    - Internal (focus):
        - Outlined policies  
        - Procedures  
        - Best practices.  

# Internal audits
- Typically conducted by a team of people that might include an org's compliance officer, security manager, and other security team members.  
- Used to help improve an org's security posture and avoid fines from governing agencies due to a lack of compliance  
- Identify organizational risk, assess controls, and correct compliance issues.  

## Common elements

- Scope and goals:
    - Scope: specific criteria of an internal security audit  
        - Requires an org to identify people, assets, policies, procedures, and technologies that might impact an org's security posture.  
        - Ex.: assessing user permissions; identifying existing controls, policies, and procedures; and accounting for the technology currently in use by the organization
    - Goals: what an org want to achieve in order to improve their security posture.  
        - Ex.: implementing core functions of frameworks, like the NIST CSF; establishing policies and procedures to ensure compliance; and strengthening system controls.  
- Risk assetment:
    - Focused on identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.  
    - Helps organizations consider what security measures should be implemented and monitored to ensure the safety of assets.
    - Ex.: this risk assessment highlights that there are inadequate controls, processes, and procedures in place to protect the organization's assets. Specifically, there is a lack of proper management of physical and digital assets, including employee equipment. The equipment used to store data is not properly secured. And access to private information stored in the organization's internal network likely needs more robust controls in place.

- What is the audit meant to achieve? 
- Which assets are most at risk? 
- Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets? 
    - If not, what controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?   
Considering questions like these can support your ability to complete the next element: a controls assessment.

- Controls assessment:
    - Closely reviewing an organization's existing assets  
    - Evaluating potential risks to those assets  
    - Ensure internal controls and processes are effective  
    - Some types:
        - Administratives: related to the human component of cybersecurity.
            - Policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data.   
            - Ex.: the implementation of password policies.   
        - Technical: hardware and software solutions used to protect assets.  
            - Ex.: the use of intrusion detection systems, or IDS's, and encryption
        - Physical: measures put in place to prevent physical access to protected assets.  
            - Ex.: surveillance cameras and locks.  
- Compliance regulations:
    - Laws that organizations must follow to ensure private data remains secure.  
    - Ex.: the organization conducts business in the European Union and accepts credit card payments. So they need to adhere to the GDPR and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS.
- Communication:
    - Results and recommendations need to be communicated to stakeholders  
    - Summarizes the scope and goals of the audit.  
    - Lists existing risks and notes how quickly those risks need to be addressed.   
    - Identifies compliance regulations the organization needs to adhere to and provides recommendations for improving the organization's security posture.

## Factors that affect audits

Factors that determine the types of audits an organization implements include: 
- Industry type  
- Organization size  
- Ties to the applicable government regulations  
- A business’s geographical location  
- A business decision to adhere to a specific regulatory compliance  

## The role of frameworks and controls in audits
Frameworks are designed to help organizations prepare for regulatory compliance security audits. 

- Prganizations can save time when conducting external and internal audits.  
- Can support organizations’ ability to align with regulatory compliance requirements and standards.  

# Audit checklist

It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

- Identify the scope of the audit
    - The audit should:
        - List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 
        - Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
        - Indicate how often an audit should be performed
        - Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees
- Complete a risk assessment
    - A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).
- Conduct the audit
    - When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.
- Create a mitigation plan
    - A strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 
- Communicate results to stakeholders
    - Providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
