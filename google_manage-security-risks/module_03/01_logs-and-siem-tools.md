# Introduction

Log: record of events that occurs within an org's systems and networks.  
The commons:
- Firewall logs: a record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet.  
    - Also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network.  
- Network logs: a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network.  
    - Also includes connections between devices and services on the network.  
- Servers logs: a record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares.  
    - Also includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.  

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool: an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.  
- Provides real-time visibility, event monitoring and analysis  
- Automate alerts  
- Stores all log data in a centralized location  
- Index and minimizes the number of logs a security professional must manually review and analyze  
- Must be configured and customized to meet an org's needs 
- Create dashboards
    - Comprehensive summary of security-related data  
    - Provides stakeholders with different metrics  
        - Metric: key technical atributes (such as reponse time, availability, and failure rate)  
        - Used to assess the performance of an software application.  

# Current SIEM tools

- The collected data is used to conduct a thorough analysis of any potential security threat, risk, or vulnerability identified. 
- Many dashboard options
- Currently, SIEM tools require human interaction for analysis of security events.  

# The future of SIEM tools

- Need for cloud funcionalities has increased  
- Cloud-hosted: 
    - Operated by vendors who are responsible for maintaining and managing the infrastructure required to use the tools.  
    - Accessed through the internet  
    - Ideal for organizations that don't want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.  
- Cloud-native:
    - Fully maintained and managed by vendors and accessed through the internet.  
    - Designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities (such as availability, flexibility, and scalability).

# The parallels of accessibility and security

Acessibility: making information, activities, or even environments meaningful, sensible, usable to as many people as possible.

- Decisions we make based on our own abilities to enhance security can actually be ineffective.
    - Color red for indication of warning: for someone who's colorblind, it'll be inneffective.  
- It's important to get user research and feedback and a range of abilities in terms of testing the effectiveness of your security mitigations
