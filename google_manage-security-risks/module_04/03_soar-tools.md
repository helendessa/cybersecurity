# Introduction 

Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR): a piece of software used to automate repetitive tasks generated by tools such as
a SIEM or managed detection and response (MDR).

# Playbooks and SOAR tools

SOAR tools are similar to SIEM tools in that they are used for threat monitoring.
- If a user attempts to log into their computer too many times with the wrong password, a SOAR would automatically block their account to stop a possible intrusion. Then, analysts would refer to a playbook to take steps to resolve the issue.
